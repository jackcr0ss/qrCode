# QR Code Generator

This is a Python3 QR Code Generator which has a source field for what you want to open when the image is scanned, and an input for the name of the image for when it is created. This script uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and the QRCode Library in order to create and open the generated QR Code. The purpose of this code is to make the creation and usage of QR Codes quick and easy. Long term this can be a very efficient way to share a Résumé with a recruiter simply.

# Usage 
In order to use this script you must have Python3 downloaded along with the following libraries installed as well.

The Python Imaging Library for opening the image:
```
pip install pillow
```

Also the QRCode Library in order to create the QRCode image:
```
pip install qrcode
```

# Future Versions 
Future plan is to implement it so that files can be viewed via scanning, and also downloaded.
