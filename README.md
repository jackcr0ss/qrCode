# QR Code Generator
This is a Python3 QR Code Generator which has a source field for what you want to open when the image is scanned, and an input for the name of the image for when it is created.

# Usage 
In order to use this script you must have Python3 downloaded along with the following libraries installed as well.

The Python Imaging Library for opening the image:
```
pip install pillow
```

Also the QRCode Library in order to create the QRCode image:
```
pip install qrcode
```

# Future Versions 
Future plan is to implement it so that files can be viewed via scanning, and also downloaded.
